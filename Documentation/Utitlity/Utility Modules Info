MODULE NAME: Messages

MODULE DESCRIPTION: Messages sent to the user can be set to a specific
  language in the settings. The Messages module will return the message in
  the language specified in the user's settings. It looks at the user settings/config
  file and discerns the language the user wants a message to be relayed in.
  Now that the language is known, it picks the file containing the messages
  in that language. Using the message code it will find the matching message
  and return it.
