What makes ours unique?
Our own perspectives:  What are key features we want?

My take:
One major violation of biophilic design principles by software:  PRIVACY.  Our need for privacy is instinctual!  
Obviously we don't have to collect user data, and our code will be open source. Anything else?

Color:  Make sure to have multiple color schemes:  
-easy on the eyes, warm natural tones, not too dark, saturated, or light.
-accessible with attention to color contrast and color blindness, etc.
-adjustable size settings for text
-night mode or something similar

Sound:  Vary anything that might repeat really often between a couple of options (annoyance factor)
